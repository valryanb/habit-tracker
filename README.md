🍮 Habit Tracker

A habit tracker using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS and Chart.JS. 
This tracker shows progress on a GitHub inspired contributions graph, a radar graph and via a habit tracking log.

The code is free to use or edit, but please don't claim as your own on your portfolio. It's going on mine!

Enjoy. ☺️
